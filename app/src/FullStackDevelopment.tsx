          Full-stack development is the process of creating a complete product, from back-end to
          front-end. This includes everything from the smart contract and app development to the
          user interface (UI) and utilising various tools to pull it all together. By creating a
          full-stack app, developers can more easily understand how each part of an application
          works. The goal is to create something that is not only functional but also aesthetically
          beautiful.
